                                for coordinating time sensitive shipments to almost anywhere in the world.This can be particularly advantageous
                                for smaller and mid - sized companies as it allows them to participate in international trade in an expeditious and effective manner.
Shipping by air also offers the advantage of a high level of security as airport controls over cargo are tightly managed.

                                    Used in conjunction with other forms of shipping, like marine, rail and ground, air freight became widely utilized as one of the 
                                    central delivery options in importing and exporting at the beginning of the Twentieth Century.Growing exponentially as an industry 
                                    during the expansion of trade networks and markets in the last 40 years, air freight is now regarded as an efficient means to ship nationally and internationally.

                                    Customs brokerage firms can determine the most reliable and cost - effective means
                                    for using air freight options to coordinate corporate, individual parcel or shipment deliveries.

                                    As with all international shipping, customs clearance procedures must always be anticipated and properly documented.
